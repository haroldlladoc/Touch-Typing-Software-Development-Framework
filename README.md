Project Title: Touch Typing Software Development Framework

Overview
The Touch Typing Software Development Framework is a fully open source, fully customizable framework ready for use. 

Installation
To install, download all the files (and subfolders) to a new folder in your computer and maintain the directory structure and do not alter the file names and folder names to avoid any broken links.

Text Customization
Out of the box, each HTML file has a text "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" that can be modified according to the users/developers needs.

Image Customization
All the images respond to the upcoming keystroke and are stored in the images and images_kp folder. To customize the images, simply replace the images with your custom made image ensuring that:
1. the replacement image follows the original name as included
2. the replacement image must be the same size, especially the keyboard, to ensure that the keyboard and hand movements are rendered properly
